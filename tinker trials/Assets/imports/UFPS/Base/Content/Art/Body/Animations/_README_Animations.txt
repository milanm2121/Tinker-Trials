- This folder contains animations in no particular order that are provided for prototyping, demonstration and testing purposes only.

- Most have been gathered from various free Unity examples. Others have been slapped together in 5 minutes for quick tests.

- Some of these animations may not work as expected, and some may not suite every character rig. It's demo content only.

- For your actual game we strongly recommend obtaining a more comprehensive and higher quality animation library.
